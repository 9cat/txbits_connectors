# txbits_connectors
Connectors to allow TxBits to interface with non-btc derived crypto currencies.

TxBits wasn't really designed to connect with crypto currencies which are not derived directly from BTC.
The connectors here are designed to allow easier connection between your TxBits based exchange and these other cryptos such a [STEEM](www.steemit.com/@tradeqwik) and [GOLOS](www.golos.io/@tradeqwik).

Be advised that these were created to work with [TradeQwik](www.tradeqwik.com) a real working exchange running on the TxBits platform. 
[TradeQwik](www.tradeqwik.com) like all real exchanges has some subtle but critical changes from TxBits.  

Therefore it is strongly advised that you do not use these connectors directly, but feel free to use them as a basis for your own and please feel free to commit connectors for your favorite crypto and submit them here.

It is important that you read the README for each connector to understand fully how it works.
